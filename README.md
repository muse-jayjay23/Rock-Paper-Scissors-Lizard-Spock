# Rock, Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock

![The overall view of the web page](/assets/images/Project%202%20page%20image.png "The overall view of the web page")

The website is based on the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock game made famous in the Big Bang Theory. The site will target people who know/love the game or the show as well as anyone who enjoys playing online chance-based games. The site is styled with this in mind, using appropriate fonts and colours as well as an updated score board that will pique the interest of the target audience.

## Features

###	Header

![Header of the website](/assets/images/Header.png "Header of the website")

The website features a header at the top of the page. This header displays the title of the site/game and is using the ‘share tech’ google font as well as vintage gamer type colours that fit well with the content of the site as well as being very visible.

### Scoreboard

![scoreboard for the game](/assets/images/scoreboard.png "scoreboard for the game")

The first item underneath the header is a score board. The div includes two more divs that display the user and computer names as well as span elements that update and display the score of the game as this continues. I went for a minimal style here, something akin to a pong game scoreboard as I felt that this was appropriate for the site content. Colours are designed to contrast against each other to easily see the score.

###	Result Header

Underneath the scoreboard is a message banner. The default text entices the user to play the game, but after this displays the results of the matching up between the user and computer choices once the user selects an option. This is done using backticks and ${} brackets as in the module content on the website. I used a lighter font colour here to contrast the darker background better and use a h2 tag to make the writing nice and large. 

### User Choices

Then, below this, we have the user’s options in the game. Each option uses an image representing rock, paper, scissors etc. I chose these images as the pastel colours fit well with the overall colour scheme of the website and the pseudo function animation upon hover adds to the level of feedback to the user. The separate colours of the options also help the user differentiate between the buttons. 

### Action Message

![action message](/assets/images/action%20message.png "action message")

Underneath this is a simple action message. This is designed to border the choices a little better rather than having a bit of empty space. The message is also designed to focus the user on choosing an option in the game.

### Footer

![footer](/assets/images/footer.png "footer")

At the bottom of the page is the footer. The aim of this game is to help people with no understanding of the game to be able to play. I had the idea to do this after watching the example project video on the course website. Again the colours used are consistent and provide good contrast between the background colour and the text.

### Features Left to Implement

I would like to implement a point where the user is either congratulated or commiserated for winning or losing once either the user or computer get to a certain score.
